## My portfolio website

This portfolio website showcase my undestarding of new core skills I learned last two weeks: flexbox, media queries, grid and CSS variables. 

Please note, that in order to fill the work sections with projects and showcase my knowledge of grid, I borrowed three websites (develeped by other proffessional web devevlopers): meditation club, cake shop and imperial building solutions. So all credits go to them.  I will replace them with my own projects very soon.
